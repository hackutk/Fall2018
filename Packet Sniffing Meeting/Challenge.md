# Challenge 1
The same truck that provided a .pcap file for the workshop also lost another file (**image1.pcapng**). This time, we know that a super secret photo was transmitted between two co-workers. However, our boss does not know whether or not that photo was NSFW and cannot take any action yet. Your boss knows that the communication happened:
- Over TCP
- One of the machines was communicating over port 9090

Can you help your boss and recover the image?
