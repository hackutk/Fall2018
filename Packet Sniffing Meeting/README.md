A packet capture file (**first.pcapng**) fell off a truck and landed inside this repositoy. Word on the street that the truck was driving on is that a secret flag exists in one of these packets. To help find it, we know the following information:
- It was transmitted using TCP
- One of the hosts was communicating through port 9090
