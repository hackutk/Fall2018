## Workshop
#### Cipher Text
The cipher text that you need to try and decrypt is in **encrypted.txt** in this repository. The plaintext was encrypted using a substitution cipher (i.e. each letter of the english alphabet has been mapped to a different letter in the english alphabet).
#### English Letter Frequencies
The frequencies of letters that you should compare against for this cipher text are in **freqs.csv** in this repository. Letters than in the ciphertext that share frequencies with the letters in this file should reveal the key used for the substitution cipher.
